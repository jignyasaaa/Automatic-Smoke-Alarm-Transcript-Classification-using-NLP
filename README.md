### 🧩 Models Used
| Model | Description | Strength |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Naive Bayes | Simple and fast probabilistic model | Great for text-based data |
| Logistic Regression | Linear baseline | Balanced accuracy and interpretability |
| Random Forest | Ensemble model | Highest accuracy and robustness |

### ⚙️ Why This Approach?
- **TF-IDF** converts text to numerical form effectively.  
- **Random Forest** captures complex patterns with minimal overfitting.  
- The pipeline is interpretable and easy to deploy.
