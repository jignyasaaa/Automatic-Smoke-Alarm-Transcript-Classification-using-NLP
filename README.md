# 🚨 911 Emergency Call Category Classifier

## 🧠 Overview
This project focuses on **classifying 911 emergency calls** into categories such as **Fire**, **EMS**, and **Traffic** using **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
It aims to help emergency services respond faster and more efficiently by automatically categorizing incoming call texts.

## 🧪 Experiments / Results Summary

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Naive Bayes | 97.3 % | 0.972 | 0.973 | 0.972 |
| Logistic Regression | 98.1 % | 0.981 | 0.981 | 0.981 |
| Random Forest | 99.2 % | 0.992 | 0.992 | 0.992 |

### 📊 Visualization Examples
- **Prediction distribution**
- **Confusion matrix**
- **Category frequency chart**

🧩 **Random Forest** was the most reliable model with minimal overfitting.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project shows how **ML + NLP** can automate emergency call classification with near-human accuracy.

---

## ✅ Key Learnings
- **Random Forest** outperformed linear models for complex patterns.  
- **TF-IDF** remains an effective representation for short text.  
- **Streamlit** simplifies interactive deployment for real-world use.  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Handle **multi-label emergencies** (e.g., “FIRE: ACCIDENT INVOLVING INJURY”).  
- Integrate **live emergency APIs** for real-time classification.  
- Experiment with **deep learning models** (BERT, RoBERTa).
